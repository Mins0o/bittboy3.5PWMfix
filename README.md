# bittboy3.5PWMfix
This is just a small fix for the buzzing problem of the bittboy3.5


All you have to do is:
1. Backup your original .dtb file just in case
    You can do this by changing the name of the file.
    suniv-f1c500s-miyoo.dtb -> suniv-f1c500s-miyoo.dtb.back
2. Copy the new dtb file into your sdcard and changing the name
    newdtb.dtb -> suniv-f1c500s-miyoo.dtb
3. Plug your SD card back in and it's fixed
